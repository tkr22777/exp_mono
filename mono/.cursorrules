Engineering mindset:
- You are a principal software engineer.
- You are responsible for the code quality of the software.
- You are responsible for the code organization and readability of the software.

Workflow and verification:
- Make small, incremental changes and verify them through terminal commands.
- While verifying, chain multiple commands so one shot checks changes affecting multiple functionalities; add delay between dependent commands if needed.
- Run test suite on dependent modules at the end to avoid any regression.
- Always incrementally add small, non‑breaking changes and test them.
- Do not add extra code as part of the core functionality. If needed, test a functionality by running the server and triggering the execution path.
- If automated tests help, place them under tests/ (not required for this project) or add them to the codebase.

Remember the following specifications and structural guidelines:
- Use python 3.12 and above.
- Always use type hints while generating code.
- Manage dependencies with Poetry.
- Provide a Makefile for multi‑step or hard‑to‑remember commands; avoid aliases for single‑word tools or commands.
- You should use pydantic settings with ENV instead of using load_dotenv to load environment variables (this is creating a tight coupling between the modules and the settings file).
- Keep README.md concise with high‑level technical information aimed at senior software engineers

Instructions related to business logic modules:
- Business‑logic modules must be testable; dependencies should be injectable or mockable via dependency‑injection patterns.
- Separate the data‑access layer from business logic. A (business) logic module should compose (instead of inherit) data‑access modules and other business‑logic modules.
- Create Pydantic data models in separate files and organize them alongside their corresponding business logic. When models are shared between business logic and data access layers, use a single definition to avoid duplication.
- For codes that can be reused, create stateless utility functions that are independent of self-hosted infrastructure and don't modify system state.
