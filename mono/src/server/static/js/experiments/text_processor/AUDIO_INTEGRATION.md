# Audio Recording Integration

This document outlines the integration of audio recording capability with the Text Processor experiment.

## Current Implementation

### Frontend Components

1. **AudioRecorder Component**
   - Handles microphone permissions and audio recording
   - Provides visualization of audio levels during recording
   - Manages the recording state and audio playback
   - Prepares audio data for processing

2. **Integration with TextProcessor**
   - Audio recording UI is embedded in the Text Processor interface
   - Simulated transcription processing with loading indicators
   - Recorded audio can be played back within the interface

### Features Implemented

- ✅ Audio recording with visual feedback
- ✅ Audio playback of recorded content
- ✅ Real-time audio level visualization
- ✅ Error handling for permissions and browser compatibility
- ✅ UI integration with existing Text Processor
- ✅ Simulated transcription flow

## Planned Implementation

### Backend Integration

1. **Audio Processing API Endpoints**
   - `/experiments/audio-processor/api/transcribe` - Convert audio to text
   - `/experiments/audio-processor/api/process-audio` - Process audio with multimodal AI

2. **Audio Processing Services**
   - Speech-to-text conversion
   - Direct audio analysis with multimodal AI models
   - Audio feature extraction and analysis

### Enhanced Features

- ⏳ Real audio transcription using speech-to-text APIs
- ⏳ Direct audio processing with multimodal AI models
- ⏳ Support for different audio formats and quality levels
- ⏳ Progress tracking for long-running audio processing tasks
- ⏳ Error handling and recovery for failed audio processing
- ⏳ Audio compression options before sending to backend

## Technical Details

### Audio Recording Implementation

The audio recording feature uses the Web Audio API and MediaRecorder API to capture audio from the user's microphone. Key components include:

- `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for microphone access
- `MediaRecorder` for capturing audio streams
- `AudioContext` and `AnalyserNode` for audio visualization
- `URL.createObjectURL()` for creating playable audio URLs

### Next Steps for Implementation

1. Set up backend infrastructure for audio file handling
2. Integrate with speech-to-text service (e.g., OpenAI Whisper API)
3. Implement multimodal AI processing capabilities
4. Add configuration options for audio quality and processing
5. Enhance error handling and user feedback

## Testing Plan

1. Test microphone access across different browsers and permissions scenarios
2. Validate audio recording quality and formats
3. Test transcription accuracy across different audio conditions
4. Measure performance and optimize for larger audio files
5. Test error handling and recovery paths

## Getting Started with Development

To continue development on the audio integration:

1. Check the TODOs in AudioRecorder.jsx and TextProcessor.jsx
2. Implement the backend endpoints in audio_processor.py
3. Set up the necessary AI services for audio processing
4. Update the UI to provide feedback during actual processing
